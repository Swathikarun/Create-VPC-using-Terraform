# Create VPC using Terraform

## Objective

This tells you how to build a tf file to create a VPC using [Datasource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/data-sources/availability_zones) and [cidrsubnet functions](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/functions/cidrsubnet.html) via Terraform tool.

## Prerequisites

- Install [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli?in=terraform/aws-get-started)

- [AWS IAM user with access to VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.html#users_change_permissions-add-console)

## Usage

- Install [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

- Clone the repository

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Swathikarun/Create-a-VPC.git

$ cd Create-a-VPC/

$ terraform init

$ terraform validate

$ terraform apply
```

*Note : Enter the region, access_key, secret_key in the `provider.tf` file before `terraform apply`*

## Result


```sh
$ terraform apply
var.region
  Enter a value: yes


Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
